# Multi Availability Zone AWS Terraform

Contained within is a Terraform project that provides a straightforward
way to bring up numerous distributed environments across three availability zones 
within an AWS region.

##Prerequisites

You will need to:
* Install [Terraform 0.10.6+](https://www.terraform.io) 
* Setup an [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/account/)

Optional:
* If you are not wed to Vim/Nano/Emacs :wink: then I would highly recommend using [IntelliJ Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download).
It is an excellent IDE with support for [HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL),](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl) 
Terraform's configuration syntax of choice.
